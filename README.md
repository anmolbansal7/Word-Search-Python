## Abstract
Word Search Algorithms are used in everyday life from our phones to our personal computers everything has the use of such an algorithm. Word Searching, which comes under the class of string-matching algorithms is worth studying with text processing being so big these days. These algorithms lie at the fundamentals of much practical software relying on efficient searching of occurrences of a particular word. We aim to solve the problem of word or string searching using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm, which searches for a substring (W), in a given string (S), in O[m+n] time (where m and n are the lengths of W and S). By implementing this algorithm in both serial and parallel computing, we may find differences that will help to conclude the efficiency of the algorithm.
